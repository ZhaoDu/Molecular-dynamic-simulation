# MD simulation of construction materials

This project is mainly about molecular dynamic simulation of asphalt binder and asphalt aggregate interface by lammps. Considering the simulation procedures, codes were roughly divided into following parts. Details will be added in the future.
* Modeling of asphalt and aggregate
* Dynamic relaxation of simulation models
* Pull-off simulation of asphalt/aggregate interface
* AFM/Nanoindentation simulation
## Modeling
### Modeling of asphalt


### Modeling of quartz

### Modeling of asphalt-aggregte interface
